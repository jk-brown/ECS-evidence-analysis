title: "Plotting ECS distirbutions from estimated gamma distributions"

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Goal 

Produce a figure with the ECS samples. This may serve as a good supplemental figure for the paper to show the distribution shapes for the evidence configurations from S20, based on gamma distirbution assumption. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
# Produce figure

We produce PDF curves in a panel using the color palette and then save the figure in the `figures` directory.

This code will will produce the publication level figure. A simple visualization is available in `02_fitting_andsampling_ecs_distributions.Rmd`.

```{r}
ecs_samples_df <- readRDS("data/ecs_samples_plot_data.RDS")

# copy data to new df
ecs_df_S1 <- ecs_samples_df

# recode evidence configurations for aesthetics
ecs_df_S1$evidence <- ecs_samples_df$evidence %>%
  recode(
    No_Process = "No Process",
    No_Historical = "No Historical",
    No_Paleoclimate = "No Paleoclimate",
    Baseline_Emergent_constraints = "Baseline + Emergent constraints"
  )

# edit order of the facet panels
facet_order <- c(
  "Baseline",
  "No Process",
  "No Historical",
  "No Paleoclimate",
  "Baseline + Emergent constraints"
)

# convert the evidence configuration to factor with the facet order we want
ecs_df_S1$evidence <- factor(ecs_df_S1$evidence, levels = facet_order)

# plot with ggplot"
